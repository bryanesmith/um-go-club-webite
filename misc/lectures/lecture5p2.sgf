Focus : Openingyithril [1d\]: well wait a bit for the others
bourbaki [1k\]: scribing is harder than i imagined
yithril [1d\]: yes it is

bourbaki [1k\]: exactly: when we attach to our opponents stones they get stronger
hidan18 [1k\]: andy is white?
hidan18 [1k\]: :o
bourbaki [1k\]: this makes black needlessly strong
bourbaki [1k\]: if you get strong and they stay the same, it's spectacular

(;B[de]TR[cf][df][cg][dg]C[Wrong direction.  Building influence here doesn't really mean much for B because the bottom is pretty solid.bourbaki [1k\]: it erases black's ability to take the upper right corner
bourbaki [1k\]: when we do this, we're saying we want to build influence while white takes territory
shika12 [8k\]: yes
bourbaki [1k\]: main idea: big and urgent mvoes in the opening
bourbaki [1k\]: get to them fast
bourbaki [1k\]: it is much bigger and more efficent to develop the right side because thats where his stones are pointing
bourbaki [1k\]: like this, we build influence where it is not very useful

bourbaki [1k\]: white plays a very greedy move
Jamal [3k\]: jealous fellow
