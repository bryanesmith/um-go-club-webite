Common Opening 2

Questions:
1.  What is the meaning of A?  
2.  Why did black leave the stones on the left even though its clear they have shape weakness?  
3. How would black fix his weakness if he had sente? 
4. Does it matter if Q3 is at Q4?ghostface [1k\]: today we're going to go over another common opening


ghostface [1k\]: white makes territory, and black plays l17
ghostface [1k\]: what is the meaning of l17?
DarkLife [-\]: look familiar with low chinese or mini
shanku [17k\]: influence on the side?
Violence [?\]: treat the wall lightly, focus on the komoku stone
ghostface [1k\]: paul: his stones in the upper right are fairly light, so black can treat it as thick
ghostface [1k\]: similarly,
ghostface [1k\]: generally this is not a good move because l17 is already pincering
Violence [?\]: yeah... I can't play this opening for black either
ghostface [1k\]: the reason why i don't like this opening and the reason i chose it is because:
ghostface [1k\]: black has these for thin stones on the left and white has solid territory
ghostface [1k\]: i woudl try to warn against heavy moves, such as just connecting
Violence [?\]: heavy moves = 削除
ghostface [1k\]: we would like to treat B and C lightly
ghostface [1k\]: also keep in mind that white can form big influence on the left side
ghostface [1k\]: i brought this move up because even though it is theoretically unsound, you should not ignore it totally
ghostface [1k\]: however, if you don't like this opening then don't use it - always use moves that you understand and are comfortable with

(;W[fc]C[ghostface [1k\]: in a lot of games, pros tried to just break the shape on the left
ghostface [1k\]: the first one is f17
