September 2ndyithril [1d\]: sorry
yithril [1d\]: didnt realize
blairz74 [3k\]: yithril
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: is ok
HonFu [4k\]: why is it in this room?
blairz74 [3k\]: you doing this every sunday right?
yithril [1d\]: yeah
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: bc jon gives weekly lectures here
blairz74 [3k\]: ok
yithril [1d\]: we've had 3 sto far
blairz74 [3k\]: i giving you ownership over room for this k
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: they are normally really helpful :)
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: ok good idea blaire
yithril [1d\]: how to use the microphone?
Persona2 [13k?\]: Lol
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: I dunno I still haven't figured that out
HonFu [4k\]: oh ... is it with mic today?
Shana [2k\]: plug it in and talk?
reggel [7k\]: plug it in and go to ur setting and look for it and stuff and....ask a smart person i dont know
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: i couldn't figure it out so I don't know
Unplugged [-\]: you can't use the micro if you don't have a teaching account
Shana [2k\]: aww that sux
yithril [1d\]: oh
yithril [1d\]: that sux
yithril [1d\]: oh well
reggel [7k\]: u can make a teaching acount O.o?
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: how do you make a teaching account?
Unplugged [-\]: you can ask for it to glue
yithril [1d\]: oh ok
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: okies
yithril [1d\]: well maybe next week ill ask
yithril [1d\]: but for today ill just type
HonFu [4k\]: good for me though,, since my compis still without sound ...
Unplugged [-\]: the only condition being you have to teach regularly
yithril [1d\]: done
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: what is "regularly" ?
Unplugged [-\]: :)
despise [6k\]: unplugged you seem to have been waiting to say that
Unplugged [-\]: i just came in, despise
despise [6k\]: oh lol
yithril [1d\]: ok lets begin
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: YEY!
yithril [1d\]: bit of a delay today cuz of comp stuff
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: *throws party*
yithril [1d\]: ill say this again at the end but
yithril [1d\]: for past lectures
yithril [1d\]: you can go to http://www.umich.edu/~goclub/resources.html
reggel [7k\]: *calls cops to stop chem's party cuz i feel like it*
yithril [1d\]: and ther are sgf files you can download to study at your own convenience
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: *introduces reggel to a hot girl and waits to see what happens* :p
yithril [1d\]: so todays topic is a bit of a misnomer
yithril [1d\]: because sanrensei is much different in terms of definite lines of play than say the mini chinese or the high/low chinese fusekis
yithril [1d\]: that is to say

;B[pj]C[ChemBoy613 [6k\]: is the wedge normal against mini-chinese?
yithril [1d\]: yes, but we'll save that for another day
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: kz
despise [6k\]: so no microphone?
yithril [1d\]: cant :/
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: no mic this week
yithril [1d\]: need teaching account
yithril [1d\]: next week should be ok
despise [6k\]: aww i cant watch while i play
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: hehe
yithril [1d\]: so this is the sanrensei
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: stay on topic guys only so much time
yithril [1d\]: given the strength level of people in the room i would say youd all be familiar with this
yithril [1d\]: persona have you seen this formation before?
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: even 20k plays sanrensei then doesn't use it right
yithril [1d\]: prolly asleep.
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: hes' in a game
reggel [7k\]: yes i use to do that fuseki all the time!
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: so probalby busy
Shana [2k\]: ya
yithril [1d\]: the purpose of the middle stone is for black to create a large amount of influence on one side of the board.
yithril [1d\]: since all the stones are high
yithril [1d\]: black is ideally seeking to make a huge box like formation
yithril [1d\]: and to create a moyo with a lot of depth
yithril [1d\]: the influence could also be used to convert other parts of the board into territory
yithril [1d\]: or break up your opponent
reggel [7k\]: i got a question....if w attacked too early at R 6 wat would probally be a good way to respond?
yithril [1d\]: influence is difficult to use in go because you invest a lot of stones and you don't know exactly how they're going to be used in the future
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: reggel - kick, remove base, chase
yithril [1d\]: if you dont make them work then you spent a lot of moves for nothin
yithril [1d\]: g
yithril [1d\]: first
yithril [1d\]: a common mistake
]
(;W[qf]TR[jc][jq]C[yithril [1d\]: this move is too early
LucSengoku [4k\]: that move isnt good direction
yithril [1d\]: white has no help on either side of the board
yithril [1d\]: and he immediately invades the part of the board where black has the most influence
yithril [1d\]: as chem says
yithril [1d\]: we should immediately take advantage as b
yithril [1d\]: so as we see
yithril [1d\]: this is totally wrong
reggel [7k\]: wen w went to 0 17
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: he means

;B[qe]C[yithril [1d\]: kick the stone to remove its eyespace

(;B[nd]C[yithril [1d\]: now q10 is in the way of w
yithril [1d\]: for a reason
yithril [1d\]: its so white cant attach and make strength
yithril [1d\]: ur already pincering white
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: okies
yithril [1d\]: q10 is doing its jumb
yithril [1d\]: *job
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: so no need
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: k gotcha
yithril [1d\]: you dont want white to lean so

ChemBoy613 [6k\]: it's ok for black to be high bc white is weak

yithril [1d\]: also ur trying to attack

;B[ri]C[reggel [7k\]: so r 13 = no no.... got it
yithril [1d\]: this is an important move as well

masek [-\]: s10 =)there such move=)

reggel [7k\]: if w doesnt q 14 and goes to r 11 would r 13 be a good way to punish?

yithril [1d\]: shoulder hits from below
yithril [1d\]: are rarely good

yithril [1d\]: yeah and while they run you make points
yithril [1d\]: good deal

ChemBoy613 [6k\]: ouch
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: white's shape is awful
yithril [1d\]: you simply block like this
yithril [1d\]: the lower right
yithril [1d\]: is solidifying
yithril [1d\]: and white has to deal with this group
reggel [7k\]: oh....cuz wen that use to happn i used to go to r 13
yithril [1d\]: because the next move is terribly severe
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: no no R13 is awful

reggel [7k\]: if w o 15 do u punish with n 16 or do  u go to o 13?

yithril [1d\]: in future lectures
yithril [1d\]: we'll do
yithril [1d\]: now onto this
HonFu [4k\]: blach hopes for r17 right?
yithril [1d\]: its not so much hope
yithril [1d\]: its the normal move
yithril [1d\]: but there are plenty of options
yithril [1d\]: okay thats all the time i alloted for today
yithril [1d\]: so we will stop here

ChemBoy613 [6k\]: really did jon, thanks
HonFu [4k\]: thanks a lot
yithril [1d\]: any suggestions for next weeks?
yithril [1d\]: not endgame ;)
HonFu [4k\]: haha ^^
Unplugged [-\]: thx yithril
megaman [9k?\]: incasions how to handle em
megaman [9k?\]: invasions*
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: we did that last week
megaman [9k?\]: what!
yithril [1d\]: we had an invasion lecture last week
HonFu [4k\]: strange openings
Unplugged [-\]: the bad shapes -_-
HonFu [4k\]: like 5-5
megaman [9k?\]: and i messed it
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: can we do avalance?
yithril [1d\]: oh god
yithril [1d\]: shoot me
HonFu [4k\]: center openings!
yithril [1d\]: avalanche?
megaman [9k?\]: they have it in arcives right?
yithril [1d\]: yes
megaman [9k?\]: ok i'll find it thx
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: hm
HonFu [4k\]: unusual stuff which opens our minds
yithril [1d\]: todays was a bit hard
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: now about one-space low pince following a one-space high approach to komoku stone?
yithril [1d\]: wasnt any variations that stuck out as popular
yithril [1d\]: *werent
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: some of those joseki are really tough

yithril [1d\]: first

yithril [1d\]: exactly
yithril [1d\]: q10 is is not in a place that is easy to develop from
yithril [1d\]: the original meaning to retain influence on the right side
yithril [1d\]: is pretty much erased
yithril [1d\]: when white r14
yithril [1d\]: blacks stones are not efficient

(;B[qd]C[yithril [1d\]: this is the correct direction and the reason we pincered white

(;W[nb]
;B[me]LB[qh:B][ql:A]C[yithril [1d\]: im sure most of us have seen this joseki
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: this is so beautful for black
yithril [1d\]: now
yithril [1d\]: b's wall at q16
yithril [1d\]: works in conjunction with q10
yithril [1d\]: which links to q4
yithril [1d\]: so now b's influence is radiating across the entire board
yithril [1d\]: first off
yithril [1d\]: let me make a few comments
yithril [1d\]: that relate back to my earlier comments about why influence is hard
yithril [1d\]: i want to stress
yithril [1d\]: that black has influence not territory
yithril [1d\]: white took territory in the upper right
yithril [1d\]: those are sure fire points
yithril [1d\]: black builds a large framework
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: I just have a feeling that B's result is far superior here :)
yithril [1d\]: but later if white has patience and builds strenght, or is just plain good at fighting
yithril [1d\]: moves like A and B come into play in the middle game a lot
yithril [1d\]: not saying its easy
yithril [1d\]: but its possible for white to eventually invade b's moyo
]
;W[nq]C[reggel [7k\]: but why would w want to go to r 17,,,whouldnt w wanna o 15?
yithril [1d\]: also possible but taking the corner was the most popular move
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: he'll get to that in a minute :)
yithril [1d\]: cuz its territory vs influence
reggel [7k\]: oh ok
yithril [1d\]: whites strategy
yithril [1d\]: is to take points
yithril [1d\]: and say "ok black you build a big thing but what if i reduce it just enough to win?
HonFu [4k\]: can black play o15 now?
HonFu [4k\]: o 5
HonFu [4k\]: sorry
]
(;B[lq]C[yithril [1d\]: but i digress
HonFu [4k\]: wont kick and attack work after A?
HonFu [4k\]: Or, sorry
yithril [1d\]: there are a bajillion things you can do at any given moment
yithril [1d\]: try to work it out yourself with gobase or moyo go or if you have time
yithril [1d\]: get out a board
yithril [1d\]: and try things
yithril [1d\]: its a good way to learn
HonFu [4k\]: ^^

yithril [1d\]: the marked stones

;W[hq]C[yithril [1d\]: in this game white went here
yithril [1d\]: h3
yithril [1d\]: since k4 is high
yithril [1d\]: its got a weakness beneath
yithril [1d\]: and white is emphasizing territory this game
yithril [1d\]: hence the sliding at the top
LucSengoku [4k\]: whats the response here
yithril [1d\]: ill give everyone a few seconds to think on that
yithril [1d\]: whats a good response for b here?
despise [6k\]: wat id miss
reggel [7k\]: im geussing h 4
HonFu [4k\]: leave it for now?

ChemBoy613 [6k\]: K4 or tenuki
reggel [7k\]: h 4 is my best geus
yithril [1d\]: theres a stone at k4 ;)

ChemBoy613 [6k\]: i mean
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: K3
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: XD
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: or tenuki
yithril [1d\]: all interesting
yithril [1d\]: ok
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: both look good to me

yithril [1d\]: the cap
HonFu [4k\]: isnt this a bit early?
yithril [1d\]: ?
despise [6k\]: no
despise [6k\]: its good
yithril [1d\]: dont know why it'd be early...
HonFu [4k\]: centers still so open, no?
yithril [1d\]: its move 13
HonFu [4k\]: hmm okay
yithril [1d\]: of course its open
yithril [1d\]: we're building it ;)
despise [6k\]: if you  want center y not just tengen
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: bc
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: this move
despise [6k\]: lot easier
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: limits white's potential
yithril [1d\]: also
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: tengen does not
yithril [1d\]: it has a threat
LucSengoku [4k\]: tengen doesnt do much in this case
despise [6k\]: i mean in the beginning
yithril [1d\]: they're no tthe same but the difference is not blakc and white
despise [6k\]: the san thingy just takes longer
LucSengoku [4k\]: this move....white can enter the moyo
yithril [1d\]: tengen is unclear how it develops
yithril [1d\]: or how it will be useful
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: sanrensei has more direction
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: :)
yithril [1d\]: anyways

(;W[fq]C[ChemBoy613 [6k\]: i was white ofc :)
yithril [1d\]: so white will defend
despise [6k\]: instead of going out of your way for all these moves when you could start with tengen
yithril [1d\]: this is a good shape to know
yithril [1d\]: tengen isnt that great
yithril [1d\]: i hate to burst your bubble ;)
HonFu [4k\]: haha ^^
yithril [1d\]: its not a clear move
despise [6k\]: wats so bad about it
yithril [1d\]: its not bad
LucSengoku [4k\]: its not bad
HonFu [4k\]: but what do, if black played tengen instead?
yithril [1d\]: its unclear
despise [6k\]: it helps build moyo for later
despise [6k\]: i mean i get wat this does no doubt
LucSengoku [4k\]: cant white k2 or j4 and enter moyo?
despise [6k\]: but they both end in moyo
yithril [1d\]: its better to be patient
LucSengoku [4k\]: blacks shape is messed up at j3

yithril [1d\]: whole board ones

yithril [1d\]: i create them  on my own

yithril [1d\]: where?
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: I think the site went down XD  there was a site masek showed me with go stuff
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: also there are good problems in "in the begining"
yithril [1d\]: always could do more
