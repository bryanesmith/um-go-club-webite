<b><li>Hey, <br />
<br />
I just graduated from MSU and moved back into the area, looking to visit a <br />
go club now.  While I'm 7kyu on KGS, I've never seen an actual board or <br />
anything, so I'd need to learn how to do the scoring, placing a stone, etc.  <br />
I was wondering which meeting day would have somebody cool with helping me <br />
with these things.  Also I sent a message to the webmaster and it bounced with a group permissions error. </li></b>
