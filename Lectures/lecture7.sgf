HonFu [3k\]: hi ^^
tenseiga [9k\]: hi
yithril [1d\]: yo
Iink [-\]: hi
JOmega [16k\]: thanks for giving us a lecture, yithril!
Iink [-\]: I thanks as well
Iink [-\]: lol
zatawiziOu [16k\]: hi
yithril [1d\]: so this is lecture 7 of Yithril's sunday lectures
yithril [1d\]: you can get the sgf file for this lecture as well as previous lectures
yithril [1d\]: ttp://www.umich.edu/~goclub/index.html under resources.
yithril [1d\]: i do lectures on various subjects
yithril [1d\]: so by popular demand today will be devoted to things beginners should know
zatawiziOu [16k\]: k
yithril [1d\]: i aimed this lecture at about 15 kyu and below
yithril [1d\]: so its very basic stuff, but strong players might benefit from a bit of review
yithril [1d\]: we'll be covering basic shape
yithril [1d\]: then capturing stones
yithril [1d\]: some basic endgame
yithril [1d\]: and then ill go a little into the opening
yithril [1d\]: lets first start off with shape
yithril [1d\]: here we have 6 different shapes and it is vital to have an understanding of them when u play
yithril [1d\]: when we make good shapes our stones remain strong and it becomes very easy to make territory whether its just surrounding it or attacking our opponent.
yithril [1d\]: it also makes defense easy because our opponent will have an extremely difficult time trying to counterattack if we have few to no weaknesses
yithril [1d\]: shape is highly important
yithril [1d\]: here i have listed some basic shapes
yithril [1d\]: in order of speed
yithril [1d\]: by speed, im referring to how much distance the stones cover in two moves
yithril [1d\]: slower moves are closer together while faster moves are further apart
yithril [1d\]: shape 1 is the iron pillar
yithril [1d\]: the slowest
yithril [1d\]: while 4 and 6 are much faster
yithril [1d\]: but further apart
yithril [1d\]: when we want to play a faster move we sacrifice shape
yithril [1d\]: when we play a slower move we sacrifice speed
yithril [1d\]: in ur game you need to know when to play a faster or slower move and be aware of the pitfalls of each
yithril [1d\]: we'll begin with the first shape
yithril [1d\]: the iron pillar
yithril [1d\]: as far as connectivity
yithril [1d\]: its the strongest
yithril [1d\]: black is connected no way to break the stones apart
yithril [1d\]: problem is
yithril [1d\]: the amount of space these two stones cover is quite small
yithril [1d\]: as we move onto the faster shapes
yithril [1d\]: the next one being 2
yithril [1d\]: the kosumi
yithril [1d\]: or diagonal
yithril [1d\]: its a tad bit weaker
yithril [1d\]: there is a space in between at a that could be a problem
yithril [1d\]: shape number 5 is the keima
yithril [1d\]: or knights move
yithril [1d\]: its speedier than shape 1 or 2
yithril [1d\]: but
yithril [1d\]: its got weakness
yithril [1d\]: even more so than the one space jump
yithril [1d\]: the weakness of the keima is the "waist"
yithril [1d\]: these two spots
yithril [1d\]: because
yithril [1d\]: 4 and 6 are much the same
yithril [1d\]: they're even further away from each other
yithril [1d\]: so its easier for white to pry the two stones apart
jhouse [3k\]: For #5, it's probably good to explicitly mention the ladder
yithril [1d\]: anyone not know what a ladder is?
yithril [1d\]: cuz im going to go over that later
Iink [-\]: no, cuz he can also kill c10 
jhouse [3k\]: 15k's might not see them immediately, that's my point
yithril [1d\]: so back to the other shapes
yithril [1d\]: 6 is the large keima
yithril [1d\]: and like the small keima its weakness is the waist
yithril [1d\]: depending on the stones around
yithril [1d\]: these could all be weaknesses
yithril [1d\]: but it takes stones around to exploit
yithril [1d\]: similiarly with 4
yithril [1d\]: these spots could be problems
yithril [1d\]: whether or not these spaces actually work for white
yithril [1d\]: is up to ur reading ability
yithril [1d\]: nothing replaces actual reading
yithril [1d\]: but if you are more familiar with shapes then ur eyes can focus on certain spots
yithril [1d\]: it'll give you a starting point to begin reading
yithril [1d\]: am i clear so far?
HonFu [3k\]: I can follow you ^_°
Bisector [?\]: yes
Iink [-\]: yep
Iink [-\]: =\]
yithril [1d\]: how about hte actual beginners ;)
yithril [1d\]: weve got some 16 kyus and some 14 kyus here
yithril [1d\]: good showing of ddks
yithril [1d\]: if u are confused ill go back
Radley [8k\]: The 1st line ones are worth 4 points miai and the 2nd line ones are worth 8?

yithril [1d\]: more on shape
yithril [1d\]: we'll first talk about shape number 1
yithril [1d\]: when we evaluate our shape
yithril [1d\]: we need to look at the way its connected
yithril [1d\]: and the way each stone does their job
yithril [1d\]: when i learned go shape #1 was introduced to me as the mouth shape
yithril [1d\]: you can give it any name that makes you giggle
yithril [1d\]: i can see the mouth but maybe some people cant
yithril [1d\]: whats good about thi sshape
yithril [1d\]: is its connectivity
HonFu [3k\]: how about basset's face? ^_°
yithril [1d\]: and its ease of creating eyes
yithril [1d\]: when we examine it closely
yithril [1d\]: we have two iron pillars
yithril [1d\]: slow moves but the most solid
yithril [1d\]: then jutting out from the two iron pillars
yithril [1d\]: is a one space jump
yithril [1d\]: so we have two slow moves
yithril [1d\]: supporting a faster move
yithril [1d\]: shape number 2 is just shape number one without the extra stone
yithril [1d\]: shape number 2 is the table shape
yithril [1d\]: highly connected
yithril [1d\]: very strong
yithril [1d\]: the iron pillar here
yithril [1d\]: supports
yithril [1d\]: the one space jump here
yithril [1d\]: number 3 is a more compact version of number 2
yithril [1d\]: its called the bamboo tube
shanku [16k\]: bamboooooooo
yithril [1d\]: unlike 1 and 2 though
HonFu [3k\]: ^^
yithril [1d\]: its not great in the making eyes department
yithril [1d\]: because its made of two iron pillars and no diagonal moves
yithril [1d\]: however its fantastic for connection
yithril [1d\]: now onto bad shapes
yithril [1d\]: since one of the definitions of good shape is that the shape is well connected
yithril [1d\]: it follows then that bad shape is the opposite
yithril [1d\]: disconnected shapes are bad
yithril [1d\]: number 4 and 5 are classic examples
yithril [1d\]: white is spearing through both black positions
yithril [1d\]: breaking up black into two pieces
yithril [1d\]: avoid these shapes whenever possible
yithril [1d\]: these shapes were formed when b ignored whites attack
yithril [1d\]: and gave white a second move
yithril [1d\]: for example
yithril [1d\]: in this diagram
yithril [1d\]: 5 is even worse than that
yithril [1d\]: 5 black ignored many moves
yithril [1d\]: and is hopelessly disconnected
yithril [1d\]: we move onto 6
yithril [1d\]: and 7
yithril [1d\]: 7 being a very infamous shape
yithril [1d\]: when i first started go
yithril [1d\]: the person teaching me told me never to make number 7
yithril [1d\]: the empty triangle
yithril [1d\]: compare it to 6
yithril [1d\]: which is a full tiriangle
yithril [1d\]: the difference is the marked stone
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: mmmmmmmmmmmm full triangle had dinner
yithril [1d\]: with 6 we are taking away liberties from white
yithril [1d\]: the marked white stone only has 2 liberties meaning he is weak
yithril [1d\]: with 7 we are not squeezing white
yithril [1d\]: the reason this shape is not oftentimes very good is because it becomes very easy to get low on liberties
yithril [1d\]: however i would like to stress
yithril [1d\]: that the attitude of "id rather die than make an empty triangle" is not a good policy
yithril [1d\]: sometimes its the only move
yithril [1d\]: sometimes its a fantastic move
yithril [1d\]: use ur judgement and decide if it is, otherwise, beware of it.
yithril [1d\]: the last shape in this diagram is number 8
yithril [1d\]: in chinese the "elephant eye"
yithril [1d\]: the two marked black stones
yithril [1d\]: have a poor relation ship with each other
yithril [1d\]: if its whites turn he can easily keep black from connecting
shanku [16k\]: how would one and two be formed in an actual game?
yithril [1d\]: clear so far?
yithril [1d\]: aqhh
yithril [1d\]: excellent question
yithril [1d\]: usually these shapes appear in part
yithril [1d\]: and not whole
yithril [1d\]: ud see 2 more so than you would see 1 
yithril [1d\]: in my experience
yithril [1d\]: it largely depends on the type of game
MorpheusZ [12k?\]: 1 is the net itself
yithril [1d\]: i cant generalize however because there are so many situations
yithril [1d\]: if you watch higher level players games
yithril [1d\]: try to pay attention to when these shapes come up
yithril [1d\]: and ask urself what they do
shanku [16k\]: ok
shanku [16k\]: ty
HonFu [3k\]: when an table
HonFu [3k\]: or the best shape
HonFu [3k\]: what was the name
HonFu [3k\]: is in enemy territory
HonFu [3k\]: one eye will not be enough
yithril [1d\]: shape #1?
HonFu [3k\]: yes
yithril [1d\]: mouth
yithril [1d\]: thats the way i learned it
HonFu [3k\]: right
HonFu [3k\]: whats a good follow up
HonFu [3k\]: to get a second eye
HonFu [3k\]: if its really really urgent?
yithril [1d\]: hmm
yithril [1d\]: thats also a bit too general ;)
HonFu [3k\]: same for 3
yithril [1d\]: 3 is hard to make eyes with
yithril [1d\]: because its made up of straight lines
yithril [1d\]: if you try to make one with straight lines
yithril [1d\]: theres no magic bullet
HonFu [3k\]: hmm ...
yithril [1d\]: theres hundreds of examples and situations
HonFu [3k\]: is the horse head a good folow up?
yithril [1d\]: haha
HonFu [3k\]: or a one point rather?
HonFu [3k\]: ^^
yithril [1d\]: could be
yithril [1d\]: one space is reasonable speed and decent shape
yithril [1d\]: if you need such a move then play it
HonFu [3k\]: okay, so I still have to think myself while playing ^_°
HonFu [3k\]: no, thanks Jon!
yithril [1d\]: thats what im hoping for after this lecture
yithril [1d\]: that u think on this subject while u play ;)

yithril [1d\]: ok lets move on
yithril [1d\]: killing stones
yithril [1d\]: my favorite
yithril [1d\]: the first one we'll just breeze right through
yithril [1d\]: our opponent will try to live with a stone
yithril [1d\]: because he doesnt know its dead
yithril [1d\]: number three is a bit trickier
HonFu [3k\]: but what if white can crawl out
yithril [1d\]: oops forgot to add a stone
yithril [1d\]: next up is 4
yithril [1d\]: the net
yithril [1d\]: or geta in japanese
yithril [1d\]: e4 is captured
yithril [1d\]: what we have to worry about
yithril [1d\]: is if we have a hole in our net
yithril [1d\]: if theres a hole the fish get out
yithril [1d\]: and we have no dinner
yithril [1d\]: that would be bad for black
yithril [1d\]: lastly
yithril [1d\]: the infamous ladder
yithril [1d\]: im not sure what u mean
JOmega [16k\]: ie, W playes D3 ...  you need to play E5 or F4 right away
yithril [1d\]: yeah you should take the stone
JOmega [16k\]: ok, thanks
yithril [1d\]: fill in the hole

yithril [1d\]: of how big the edge is 
yithril [1d\]: and how many points its worth
yithril [1d\]: as well as not falling into beginner pitfalls
yithril [1d\]: lets take 2 first
yithril [1d\]: the difference between 1 and two
yithril [1d\]: is that in 2 the edge black stones have more liberties
yithril [1d\]: and are therefore stronger
yithril [1d\]: wow
yithril [1d\]: almost an hour
yithril [1d\]: ok real quick

shanku [16k\]: san san!
shanku [16k\]: :P
yithril [1d\]: A is called the komoku
yithril [1d\]: B is the hoshi or star point
yithril [1d\]: D is the san san or 3,3 point
yithril [1d\]: C is the mokuhazushi 
yithril [1d\]: sometimes people use japanese terms
yithril [1d\]: so just in case uve never heard of them now u know
yithril [1d\]: we'll begin with A
dogberto [?\]: no 5,4s?
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: 5-4 also reasonably common and playable
yithril [1d\]: yeah
yithril [1d\]: i just wanted to show some basic josekis
yithril [1d\]: regarding each opening move
yithril [1d\]: in case u dont know
yithril [1d\]: a joseki is a set of standard moves that achieve a relatively even result between B and W
yithril [1d\]: however even is in the eye of the beholder
yithril [1d\]: there are thousands of josekis
yithril [1d\]: im creating my own database of them and ill let you guys know when its done
yithril [1d\]: first off
yithril [1d\]: my own personal advice
yithril [1d\]: 1. never memorize joseki, its totally useless
yithril [1d\]: 2. dont just play joseki cuz its joseki
yithril [1d\]: 3. pick moves u like whether they are joseki or not
yithril [1d\]: joseki are good to learn from
yithril [1d\]: they teach a lot about shape
yithril [1d\]: and when we already know some sequences
yithril [1d\]: we can learn a lot about go theory when we study good players game
yithril [1d\]: s
yithril [1d\]: they are useful
yithril [1d\]: however they do not replace strength in theory or reading
yithril [1d\]: i would say as a beginner
yithril [1d\]: to be familiar with some, but to spend more time doing life and death problems and really working on your reading
yithril [1d\]: the reason im doing it
yithril [1d\]: is because i wanted to show off some joseki that displayed how each corner stone works
yithril [1d\]: so you get a feel of the type of move you're playing instead of just randomly playing in the corner
yithril [1d\]: So we'll begin with A
yithril [1d\]: the komoku
yithril [1d\]: its third line meaning its low
yithril [1d\]: third line and below is low, 4th and above is high
yithril [1d\]: starting from the edge
yithril [1d\]: low moves are good for territory
yithril [1d\]: high moves are good for creating potential and attacking
yithril [1d\]: the komoku has an added bonus
yithril [1d\]: B is the star point, the hoshi stone
yithril [1d\]: its 4th line so its geared towards influence and not territory but it is flexible
yithril [1d\]: we have 3
yithril [1d\]: D
yithril [1d\]: i mean
yithril [1d\]: the 3,3 point
yithril [1d\]: a low move
yithril [1d\]: nestled snuggly in the corner
yithril [1d\]: D makes territory but it can be pressed down
yithril [1d\]: C the mokuhazushi forgoes the corfner
yithril [1d\]: for the side
yithril [1d\]: now ill show some basic josekis 
yithril [1d\]: that demonstrate the function of the opening moves
