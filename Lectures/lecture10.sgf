Tesuji (Skillful play)

Tesujis can destroy your opponent and also help you avoid getting destroyed.  In this lecture we will be covering a wide range of tesujis from beginner to expert.  FaintSmile [3k\]: this gonna be audio?
volatile [10k\]: i can't wait ^^ tesuji time :D
HonFu [3k\]: hooray, enemy destruction time ^_°
volatile [10k\]: hm...how long does it usually take you to organize a lecture?
Iink [-\]: hi yithiril =\]
HonFu [3k\]: everybody let's cut em off, squeeze em out, ladder em down! ^^ 
HonFu [3k\]: hey, GoTraurig, why are you traurig?
GoTraurig [15k\]: only 15k? :(
vitorious [15k\]: represent!
HonFu [3k\]: but soon you will be 9d, and then you are still traurig!
DarthStian [6k\]: hehe define soon
GoTraurig [15k\]: ill worry about that when it happens
DarthStian [6k\]: How do people normally advance in rank? I've been like stuck on 6k forever
DarthStian [6k\]: How fast*
HonFu [3k\]: life and death, darth!
Mendez [1k?\]: I'll ask the same. :)

Mendez [1k?\]: Hello.
volatile [10k\]: hi hi :D
HonFu [3k\]: hi ^^
Korlon [3k\]: I think he means walls
DarthStian [6k\]: What I mean is, is it normal to advance to a spesific level and then suddenly be stuck?
volatile [10k\]: mmkay
FaintSmile [3k\]: this gonna be audio or typing?
HonFu [3k\]: happens often, darth
bourbaki [1k\]: yes it is darthstian
