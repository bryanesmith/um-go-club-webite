yukiisme [12k\]: hihi
yithril [1d\]: hello
Kireta [10k\]: Hello
xthsense [1k\]: hi
xthsense [1k\]: longest variation = 27 moves XD
yithril [1d\]: not going to be variation heavy this lecture
xthsense [1k\]: yeah
xthsense [1k\]: ic that lol
Unplugged [-\]: should i advertise the lecture ?
yithril [1d\]: sure why not
Unplugged [-\]: ok
xthsense [1k\]: 2 minutes! (countdown) XD
Rotwang [5k\]: Hi
inochi33 [9k\]: yeaaaa fuseki lesson
inochi33 [9k\]: finally
yithril [1d\]: ok lets start
HonFu [4k\]: haha ^^
xthsense [1k\]:  yithril [1d\]: buh? yithril [1d\]: is w on something? oddalot [12k\]: the internet? lol yithril
yithril [1d\]: the focus of this lecture is tada fuseki
yithril [1d\]: the one idea i'd like to stress
yithril [1d\]: is that there are many many options for us to choose from in the beginning of the game
yithril [1d\]: sadly there are a lot of bad options ;)
yithril [1d\]: but there are also good ones
yithril [1d\]: we will be discussing a very common opening to learn some fuseki principles and how to apply them in our games
yithril [1d\]: the greatest lesson you can learn from this lecture is to play your style and moves that are comfortable for you

;B[oc]C[Lecture on basic opening principles :

Focus of lecture: Fuseki Strategyyithril [1d\]: ok so
yithril [1d\]: lets take stock of th board
yithril [1d\]: black has built a shimari and has a star point stone
yithril [1d\]: white has two star point stones
yithril [1d\]: usually because w goes second he does not normally go for a moyo vs moyo strategy
yithril [1d\]: b is a move ahead of us
yithril [1d\]: however that doesn't mean it isnt playable ;)
yithril [1d\]: so next idea
yithril [1d\]: lets say we dont want to play moyo vs moyo as white
yithril [1d\]: we instead want to break b up before anything big gets going
yithril [1d\]: wheres a good move for w?  this question is for 9-10 kyu or below
Firebird [9k\]: R11
inochi33 [9k\]: r11

(;W[qj]LB[fc:G][ph:H][qh:A][cj:C][ql:B][qm:E][qn:D][fq:F]C[What is the meaning of r10?

What choices does black have now?  What does each mean?  Think in terms of development of all the black stones.inochi33 [9k\]: i just like r11 than the hoshhi
yithril [1d\]: i saw more games with r 10 than r 11
yithril [1d\]: but good idea
yithril [1d\]: this splitting move
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: wedge is strong move here
yithril [1d\]: prevents b from forming a connected shape on the right side
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: does black answer from the top or from the bottom/
Firebird [9k\]: R11 is silly, you're right
xthsense [1k\]: chem, huh?
yithril [1d\]: moving into our opponents shape before they can become strong is very big
yithril [1d\]: we're going to discuss that today chem ;)
yithril [1d\]: b has MANY options here
yithril [1d\]: call out some
HonFu [4k\]: r12
Kireta [10k\]: i like r12
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: R12 looks good
Firebird [9k\]: R8
yithril [1d\]: r12 is a stellar point
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: R8 also valid
HonFu [4k\]: c10
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: I think R12 is stronger
hidan18 [1k\]: most of teh pro games ive seen the answer is r12
inochi33 [9k\]: r6
Kireta [10k\]: r7
Firebird [9k\]: R7 maybe
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: tenuki always option, F3
ILOVEMJ [20k\]: c
yithril [1d\]: ok
Firebird [9k\]: Q11
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: F17 also
ILOVEMJ [20k\]: c10 is right
Firebird [9k\]: or rather Q12
inochi33 [9k\]: anywhere really its not really a forcing move
yithril [1d\]: okay
yithril [1d\]: lets discuss them
yithril [1d\]: okay now back to here
yithril [1d\]: lets do b and e ;)
bourbaki [1k\]: wait one sec
bourbaki [1k\]: could you talk about the placement of c8 versus c7?
bourbaki [1k\]: something that i don't really get to this day
yithril [1d\]: in fact ill do that now ;)
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: Hon Fun... if you know your joseki and think hard and read them will help you make good pincer choice
yithril [1d\]: so
xthsense [1k\]: i so want that in my info, kilroy
yithril [1d\]: now
yithril [1d\]: the next move
yithril [1d\]: is a move developed by one of my favorite pros
yithril [1d\]: Liu Xing
yithril [1d\]: he is great to study if you want to learn flexibility
Firebird [9k\]: yeah
yithril [1d\]: whew
yithril [1d\]: okay 10 more minutes

yithril [1d\]: its the same kind of shape on the right

yithril [1d\]: now im not going to go into the many many many josekis that there are around here

yithril [1d\]: lets move on to this one
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: invade?
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: or O4?
Firebird [9k\]: universal answer: R8
yithril [1d\]: whats w's idea here?
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: extend and approach the corner at the same time
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: dual-purpose move
yithril [1d\]: partially
yithril [1d\]: thats no tall
Firebird [9k\]: ... at least whenever i tried so far
Shuang [4k\]: also to pressure
xthsense [1k\]: i dont want to have black play r5 on me. XD
yithril [1d\]: all good responses
yithril [1d\]: theres one more idea
hidan18 [1k\]: lol
HonFu [4k\]: r8 would trouble me
yithril [1d\]: keep in mind
yithril [1d\]: black has a weak spot
Kernel [6k\]: hrm
yithril [1d\]: this point is invadable later
hidan18 [1k\]: r8 is exchange
yithril [1d\]: the prerequisite
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: this takes away R5 beacuse the kick induces good shape for white
yithril [1d\]: to invade here is that the r10 white group is safe
yithril [1d\]: which leads me to another good principle
xthsense [1k\]: chem, i was kidding.
hidan18 [1k\]: lol
yithril [1d\]: Before we invade, we must make sure surrounding groups are safe
HonFu [4k\]: always?
yithril [1d\]: if we invade before our nearby groups are stabilized, then we run the risk of our invasion damaging our position all around
xthsense [1k\]: cause you dont want to kill yourself.
yithril [1d\]: id say thats almost an ironclad principle
HonFu [4k\]: oh #^^#
yithril [1d\]: its extremely important
xthsense [1k\]: look at yithril's old games to see his opponents kill himself
xthsense [1k\]: he's frustrated by such play
xthsense [1k\]: XD
hidan18 [1k\]: ☺
xthsense [1k\]: same with me too
yithril [1d\]: so here
yithril [1d\]: w goes for more space
yithril [1d\]: if he can stabilize
yithril [1d\]: then he can come in at b's weak spot
yithril [1d\]: get the idea?
Kernel [6k\]: yeah
yithril [1d\]:  various moves here
xthsense [1k\]: lol
yithril [1d\]: but do we at least understand the principle of this move?
HonFu [4k\]: yes
Firebird [9k\]: yes
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: yes

(;B[mq]C[Firebird [9k\]: yeah, but now turn the "if" to a "when" ...
HonFu [4k\]: but finally he will have to play Q8, no? isnt that gote then
HonFu [4k\]: ?
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: what about O4?
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: O4 looks good for black
yithril [1d\]: let me show you something
