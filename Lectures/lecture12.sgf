yithril [1d\]: lets begin
]RE[W+21.50]
;B[qd]BL[890.693]C[yithril [1d\]: have a good game
breakfast [1p\]: the opening was close to 3-4d level
breakfast [1p\]: also nice attack later
breakfast [1p\]: did you learn such attacks from Guo?
yithril [1d\]: yes
yithril [1d\]: i have attacking style
yithril [1d\]: in general
breakfast [1p\]: yes, impressive
]
;W[dd]WL[891.297]C[breakfast [1p\]: Enjoy!
]
;B[pq]BL[879.852]C[breakfast [1p\]: Our styles with Guo are different
breakfast [1p\]: you will see it
]
;W[dp]WL[875.168]
;B[od]BL[865.308]LB[qn:A][po:C][qo:B]C[breakfast [1p\]: my own style and Guo Juan's style
breakfast [1p\]: she is a fighter
yithril [1d\]: ahh ok
breakfast [1p\]: and I like to play without risk
yithril [1d\]: white will prevent black from making a second shimari
yithril [1d\]: all of these are average moves
]
(;W[qk]WL[869.241]C[yithril [1d\]: so he played this
yithril [1d\]: which i thought was a tad unusual
yithril [1d\]: normally
yithril [1d\]: when white splits of course
]
;B[qn]BL[854.61]C[breakfast [1p\]: so, I will not even give you the pincer :)
yithril [1d\]: black will make the second shimari
yithril [1d\]: and force white to settle on the side
yithril [1d\]: what we can learn from this game
yithril [1d\]: are several opening principles
yithril [1d\]: for instance where is the large side and the double shimari principle
yithril [1d\]: as well as
]
;W[qh]WL[864.134]C[yithril [1d\]: dinerchtein likes no complications
yithril [1d\]: so i guess he doesn't like black pincering
]
;B[fc]BL[848.293]C[yithril [1d\]: darn
yithril [1d\]: so i moved to the top
yithril [1d\]: i think its possible but its harder
yithril [1d\]: much much harder
roygee [10k\]: y?
yithril [1d\]: becaues it starts a fight
roygee [10k\]: how to c ?
leger [2k\]: pincer = fights
]
(;W[cf]WL[857.772]C[yithril [1d\]: this is much simpler
yithril [1d\]: and patient
]
(;B[jd]BL[840.039]LB[ic:B][jd:A]SQ[hc]C[roygee [10k\]: can w play a pincer?
yithril [1d\]: i played this which is not bad its a possibility
yithril [1d\]: difference in style
yithril [1d\]: whats the big difference between
yithril [1d\]: this?
MIchild5 [4k?\]: A works better with the stones on the right?
yithril [1d\]: partly
yithril [1d\]: both work well
yithril [1d\]: it has to do with solidity of the shape
yithril [1d\]: this move the shape is weaker
yithril [1d\]: weak spot at the square
yithril [1d\]: i picked it
yithril [1d\]: because i wanted central influence in case it became possible later to make a big thing in the center
yithril [1d\]: h17 doesn
yithril [1d\]: t bug me
yithril [1d\]: is essentially what im saiyng with this move
yithril [1d\]: clear?
roygee [10k\]: yes
]
(;W[jq]WL[854.173]C[leger [2k\]: yes
yithril [1d\]: biggest side is the bottom
yithril [1d\]: now?
roygee [10k\]: after u got two stones at the left side
roygee [10k\]: in the variation
yithril [1d\]: show me
]
(;B[cn]BL[836.598]C[yithril [1d\]: so now i have to move into whites potential
yithril [1d\]: i decided to approach
]
(;W[bo]CR[cf]WL[848.928]C[breakfast [1p\]: 4 other ideas here
breakfast [1p\]: D is interesting
yithril [1d\]: so white choes this respones
yithril [1d\]: to emphasize his corner
yithril [1d\]: if we look around
yithril [1d\]: white played this stone low
yithril [1d\]: so the left side is not big potential
yithril [1d\]: the corner is more important
yithril [1d\]: what do you think are blacks options?
yithril [1d\]: how to answer?
roygee [10k\]: can b start to invade at the lower E, F, G, H
yithril [1d\]: when roygee?
yithril [1d\]: now?
roygee [10k\]: no now need to secure c6 1st
yithril [1d\]: so when then?
yithril [1d\]: there are other options
]
(;B[fq]BL[808.491]C[yithril [1d\]: in the game i played this
yithril [1d\]: i saw Jang Bi play it in a tournament game
yithril [1d\]: so i thought 
yithril [1d\]: "what the heck ill try it"
yithril [1d\]: this is a light move
yithril [1d\]: we'll look at the game first
]
;W[eq]WL[844.161]
;B[fp]BL[806.122]
;W[en]WL[840.126]C[yithril [1d\]: important to play this move
yithril [1d\]: split black
]
;B[io]BL[792.285]C[yithril [1d\]: so we played like this
yithril [1d\]: i played this to come out
yithril [1d\]: white will have to act
]
;W[hq]WL[815.649]C[yithril [1d\]: he aims at my shape
yithril [1d\]: thats fine
]
;B[hp]BL[779.209]
;W[mq]WL[810.367]C[yithril [1d\]: i fix and then he extends
]
;B[ko]BL[758.275]
;W[nr]WL[773.481]C[yithril [1d\]: i cover and he plays o2
yithril [1d\]: it thought it was funny at first
yithril [1d\]: but now his bottom has no aji
yithril [1d\]: and
yithril [1d\]: r4
yithril [1d\]: is a problem for black later
]
;B[ck]BL[751.64]
;W[bn]WL[762.336]C[roygee [10k\]: b need to secure the above
]
;B[ch]BL[749.017]C[breakfast [1p\]: the result was exactly equal here
yithril [1d\]: overall though
yithril [1d\]: the fuseki was equal
yithril [1d\]: what do you think?
leger [2k\]: probably
indrashot [3k\]: could you replay last three moves?
indrashot [3k\]: ah. thanks
]
;W[db]WL[758.351]C[breakfast [1p\]: hard to attack me
yithril [1d\]: using posiitonal judgement
yithril [1d\]: meaning counting points
yithril [1d\]: taking stock of who is weak and who is strong
yithril [1d\]: to make clear judgements about the situation and devise a proper strategy to win
]
(;B[pj]BL[732.794]C[yithril [1d\]: ive been wanting to play this move all game
yithril [1d\]: the entire reason i played k16
yithril [1d\]: but
yithril [1d\]: in blacks dream world...
]
;W[qj]WL[752.228]
;B[ph]BL[731.309]
(;W[qg]WL[745.523]C[yithril [1d\]: instead he played this
yithril [1d\]: and my hopes were dashed

yithril [1d\]: and i dont get sente
]
;W[hc]WL[712.614]C[yithril [1d\]: so then q 10 doesnt work
yithril [1d\]: now he gets sente
yithril [1d\]: to invade me
yithril [1d\]: what should black think about now?
indrashot [3k\]: upper side looks big still
yithril [1d\]: what should be my strategy overall?
roygee [10k\]: j17?
]
(;B[hd]BL[714.643]C[yithril [1d\]: in the game i did this
]
(;W[ic]WL[707.006]C[yithril [1d\]: where should black play?

yithril [1d\]: yes :)

;W[gd]WL[697.771]
;B[he]BL[703.894]C[indrashot [3k\]: upper side big.. can still make center
]
;W[gc]WL[697.033]C[yithril [1d\]: plus a little bit of joseki choice
]
;B[ge]BL[701.008]C[yithril [1d\]: this is a needed move
yithril [1d\]: normally we dont play this in this joseki
yithril [1d\]: but here white has d18
yithril [1d\]: so
yithril [1d\]: we're not erasing any aji
]
;W[fd]WL[694.665]
(;B[fm]BL[693.456]C[yithril [1d\]: so i tried to make as big of a moyo as i possibly could
yithril [1d\]: what do we think of f7?
indrashot [3k\]: mmm...
indrashot [3k\]: still hawve a couple holes
yithril [1d\]: black is huge but a bit too open
]
;W[ki]WL[661.16]C[yithril [1d\]: white played here
indrashot [3k\]: wow...
yithril [1d\]: so now
yithril [1d\]: lets take stock of the situation
yithril [1d\]: white has lots of solid points
yithril [1d\]: corner, bottom, upper left, right
yithril [1d\]: uninvadable
yithril [1d\]: meaning
yithril [1d\]: in order for me to have 1 more point than he does at the end of the game
yithril [1d\]: this stone must die
yithril [1d\]: there are no other options
leger [3k\]: are you sure ?
yithril [1d\]: count whites territory
indrashot [3k\]: did it live?
yithril [1d\]: yes and that is why f 7 is too much
yithril [1d\]: i cant kill this stone
yithril [1d\]: im no where near thick enough
yithril [1d\]: theres too much space
leger [3k\]: let's say white has ~50 points here, solid points
indrashot [3k\]: did you play tengen?
]
(;B[kk]BL[598.806]C[yithril [1d\]: i attacked him
yithril [1d\]: the thing is
indrashot [3k\]: exciting...
yithril [1d\]: attacking this stone
yithril [1d\]: is very hard
]
;W[kf]WL[648.006]C[yithril [1d\]: so white must now back sabaki
yithril [1d\]: here
yithril [1d\]: *make not back

;W[lg]WL[479.089]TR[ig][ih][hi][hj][hk][kk][mk][nk][kl][ll][fm]C[yithril [1d\]: so i thought maybe i could make territory
yithril [1d\]: small but something
breakfast [1p\]: what did you get by attacking?
yithril [1d\]: not really anyting
breakfast [1p\]: yes, true
breakfast [1p\]: so, we can say, that I punished F7
breakfast [1p\]: now W is 10 points ahead or so
yithril [1d\]: right because if i cant kill you then im behind
breakfast [1p\]: and later I made this difference bigger in yose
yithril [1d\]: ugh
yithril [1d\]: up to here
yithril [1d\]: white lives
yithril [1d\]: and now all my moves that i gained by attacking him
yithril [1d\]: make very inefficient points
roygee [10k\]: wat those traingle stone?
yithril [1d\]: yes
yithril [1d\]: those are the moves i received from the attack
yithril [1d\]: but the trick is to conver them into points
yithril [1d\]: its all right if we attack stuff
yithril [1d\]: but we need to get points out of it
yithril [1d\]: or we dont have enough to win the game

;B[mh]BL[483.93]
;W[kh]WL[462.443]
;B[bf]BL[478.168]C[yithril [1d\]: so now
yithril [1d\]: im thinking
yithril [1d\]: "crud, white is up by 10-15 points i need to make some territory but all his  groups are rock solid
yithril [1d\]: there is nothing to attack

yithril [1d\]: his endgame is far better than mine ;)
yithril [1d\]: the endgame is not so much important
yithril [1d\]: white went on to win by about 20 points
yithril [1d\]: 10 points he gained from f7 aiming for too much
yithril [1d\]: and the rest in endgame
indrashot [3k\]: wow!
indrashot [3k\]: how did you end up playing a pro?
indrashot [3k\]: and reviewing?
yithril [1d\]: dinerchtein is not that expensive
yithril [1d\]: 15 bucks for first lesson
yithril [1d\]: so i tried him out
