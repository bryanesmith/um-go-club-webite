yithril [1d\]: why?
yithril [1d\]: its not easy 
wicket [-\]: prolly his mood at the time:)
GaretJax [7k\]: because b gets too much if he takes the corner and his group is more secure than before
apple [2d\]: hi jon - pro game reviews at 10 pm i thought
Slarty [-\]: weak B group now
ImNoSensei [-\]: very complex question, lots to read
GaretJax [7k\]: whereas now he is touching d18
wicket [-\]: other than that i'll go for the 'is weakest group' answe:)

yithril [1d\]: we're gmt -4
apple [2d\]: ah
yithril [1d\]: personally
yithril [1d\]: i think this move really weakens black at  the top
yithril [1d\]: that is correct
yithril [1d\]: also
yithril [1d\]: the black stones on the bottom
yithril [1d\]: have a slight shape weakness

ImNoSensei [-\]: let me give you the month
reggel [8k\]: but...oh forgetit
apple [2d\]: what reggel
ImNoSensei [-\]: April 2006
yithril [1d\]: kgs plus thing?
ImNoSensei [-\]: yea, in French of course
yithril [1d\]: cool
ImNoSensei [-\]: the sad thing is that W was short on time and tired
ImNoSensei [-\]: so he misread the top right
ImNoSensei [-\]: he COULD kill
yithril [1d\]: man
yithril [1d\]: thats gotta suck
apple [2d\]: yeah
ImNoSensei [-\]: also
hidan18 [1k\]: but he was still losing by about 15 anyway
ImNoSensei [-\]: he played O3 because he hadn't seen B had more threats with that second ko
hidan18 [1k\]: even if he kills
ImNoSensei [-\]: if W kills he wins
yithril [1d\]: top is really brilliant
hidan18 [1k\]: se says differently
ImNoSensei [-\]: so W played C11
hidan18 [1k\]: ☺
ImNoSensei [-\]: instead of living at bottom left
ImNoSensei [-\]: and when he played C11
ImNoSensei [-\]: he had read ALL of it
ImNoSensei [-\]: except one ko threat he hadn't seen
apple [2d\]: wow
apple [2d\]: that sucks
ImNoSensei [-\]: yea Lee ChangHo was brilliant this game
ImNoSensei [-\]: Luo Xihe had 45 minutes left
yithril [1d\]: wish i had half that much reading power
ImNoSensei [-\]: he was in byo yomi during the ko
ImNoSensei [-\]: hard to not misread something
apple [2d\]: wish i had 1/100 of the reading power displayed in the game
ImNoSensei [-\]: *cheers for W, beautiful defeat*
yithril [1d\]: hehehe
GaretJax [7k\]: Apple, if they read iven 200 moves ahead, you just wished you could read 2 moves ahead :P
ImNoSensei [-\]: this is game 1 2005 Samsung Cup right ?
apple [2d\]: sorry
yithril [1d\]: 2006
ImNoSensei [-\]: or game 2
ImNoSensei [-\]: ah yes 2006
yithril [1d\]: 1st round
apple [2d\]: garetjax, it means that they read much more
apple [2d\]: during the entire game
ImNoSensei [-\]: it's funny how next game with exact same moves W made a huge moyo
ImNoSensei [-\]: instead of B
apple [2d\]: how many sequences were read
ImNoSensei [-\]: and lost again
GaretJax [7k\]: good point, was not thinking about other sequences
yithril [1d\]: its rough being lee changho
ImNoSensei [-\]: yea =)
apple [2d\]: and how many went unread because they didnt need to even think about it
ImNoSensei [-\]: have you studied the game after this one ?
apple [2d\]: that kind of power
yithril [1d\]: i just picked t his one at random
ImNoSensei [-\]: ah
yithril [1d\]: but i think il lstudy the game after
ImNoSensei [-\]: it's a good one
ImNoSensei [-\]: good lecture =)
ImNoSensei [-\]: thanks
yithril [1d\]: i mgiht do the next game next week
hidan18 [1k\]: thx
hidan18 [1k\]: ☺
GaretJax [7k\]: I'm still proud of my g18 catch :P
ImNoSensei [-\]: Fan Hui also did the next game
ImNoSensei [-\]: so you know, if you need to prepare
