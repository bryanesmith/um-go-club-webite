(;B[jp]TR[jp][fq][pq]C[Lecture 8 - Kobayashi Openingyithril [2d\]: this very famous opening
yithril [2d\]: called the kobayashi opening
AkiraToya [1k\]: wow yithril lectures got famouse
yithril [2d\]: for those not acquainted with it
Iink [-\]: lol
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: heh, you guys see this a lot if you play me
yithril [2d\]: this shape at the bottom forms the kobayashi shape
masek [2k\]: Thril =) you can change game info in rules=)
masek [2k\]: this new feature=)
masek [2k\]: options rules=)
yithril [2d\]: so why do we play k4?
yithril [2d\]: yes this move is faster
yithril [2d\]: plus
yithril [2d\]: k4 is high
wildseven [-\]: hmm this is like chinese opening
yithril [2d\]: b is ready to attack any stone that comes too close to q 4
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: k4 helps black develop on a larger scale, it leaves the corner unresolved for later depending on board posistion and takes away Q5 and R5 as really good approach moves
yithril [2d\]: first thing
yithril [2d\]: if you hate playing against kobayashi
Shana [1k\]: aww how much did i miss
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: so as long as high pincer we are good?
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: I prefer high to low anyway
yithril [2d\]: yes
yithril [2d\]: high attacks
yithril [2d\]: although there are some fantastic games
Jamal [3k\]: the ideas apply for all games
despise [6k\]: but thx for showing it thus far
yithril [2d\]: Go is the same really

despise [6k\]: n4 
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: I prefer F17 here
yithril [2d\]: q10 is possible

(;B[qi]C[yithril [2d\]: b must play here

yithril [2d\]: if they're there take them
yithril [2d\]: alright
yithril [2d\]: now the orthodox approach

yithril [2d\]: clear so far?

yithril [2d\]: i do a lot in each lecture
yithril [2d\]: so that later
yithril [2d\]: you can go back and study
wildseven [-\]: iam a bit dizzy so nothing going in my head
yithril [2d\]: the main point
