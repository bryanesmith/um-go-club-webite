We will be studying a common invasion position but in context using examples from pro games to give us guidelines and ways of thinking to handle invasions.  Remember, never memorize joseki, create them.xthsense [2d\]: sup
yithril [1d\]: yo
xthsense [2d\]: this looks fun
hidan18 [1k\]: ☺
yithril [1d\]: lots of stuff
xthsense [2d\]: yah
hidan18 [1k\]: when does it start?
yithril [1d\]: 3 minutes or until more peopel show ;)
hidan18 [1k\]: ah
hidan18 [1k\]: ill play simul later then
hidan18 [1k\]: ☺
yithril [1d\]: its the same time every week so hopefully people know the routine
xthsense [2d\]: ^^
xthsense [2d\]: last time 25 ppl watching
yithril [1d\]: what did you guys think of las tweeks?
xthsense [2d\]: pretty good
hidan18 [1k\]: yeah
xthsense [2d\]: trigge rhapp yspaceba ryithril.
yithril [1d\]: i love the spacebar
xthsense [2d\]: lol
yithril [1d\]: its my friend
hidan18 [1k\]: lol
yithril [1d\]: hopefully a few more people show
yithril [1d\]: we'll start at 5 after at the latest
xthsense [2d\]:  l-l31P /\\/\\3
yithril [1d\]: what?
xthsense [2d\]: lol
HonFu [4k\]: Hello everybody ^^
xthsense [2d\]: hi
oplk [12k\]: hi
hidan18 [1k\]: hello
hidan18 [1k\]: ☺
kyosuke [-\]: hiya
yithril [1d\]: okay
yithril [1d\]: lets start
yithril [1d\]: todays topic is a bit of a misnomer
yithril [1d\]: while i did say invasion josekis
yithril [1d\]: i am very anti joseki
xthsense [2d\]: lol
yithril [1d\]: because it makes us think that all we have to do is memorize tons of moves
HonFu [4k\]: ^^
yithril [1d\]: and that somehow it will make us better
yithril [1d\]: studying joseki is fantastic
HonFu [4k\]: and it never works ... ^^
yithril [1d\]: you learn good shapes and good tactics
yithril [1d\]: but then we forget about the rest of our stones
xthsense [2d\]: and not the sequences
yithril [1d\]: and the josekis we pick
yithril [1d\]: dont work
yithril [1d\]: so my approach to studying joseki is what we will be doing today
yithril [1d\]: i picked a common shape
yithril [1d\]: and tried to find as many real life pro examples of how that shape is dealt with
yithril [1d\]: it helps develop a feel of how all the stones work together
yithril [1d\]: which is your main concern when playing
yithril [1d\]: okay
yithril [1d\]: so
yithril [1d\]: last one

yithril [1d\]: wall us in and make us live small on the side

yithril [1d\]: the more severe your invasion is the less choice but thats the idea
yithril [1d\]: if we get sealed they get a wall
yithril [1d\]: to attack a nearby group
yithril [1d\]: if they run us out
yithril [1d\]: they could split our groups in two

yithril [1d\]: and run in between

LucSengoku [4k\]: its gote?
HonFu [4k\]: didnt want hom to close this off?
yithril [1d\]: why did he go for the 3,3
yithril [1d\]: gote is one
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: F16 is gote and white's invasion here ends in sente
yithril [1d\]: and
LucSengoku [4k\]: that stone is already dead
yithril [1d\]: which one?
yithril [1d\]: f17?
ChemBoy613 [7k\]: black needs followup near Q10 to really make his stones work together
LucSengoku [4k\]: yes
yithril [1d\]: f17 is not dead
yithril [1d\]: without f 16
Shana [2k\]: black can take the top left corner but top right corner is bigger?
yithril [1d\]: all good answers
yithril [1d\]: lets look at the game
yithril [1d\]: the 3,3 point here
yithril [1d\]: makes black spend a lot of moves which he would otherwise use to create a large expansive moyo
HonFu [4k\]: and the other direction and then something around Q10?
HonFu [4k\]: wouldnt that work?

yithril [1d\]: force your opponent to move out into an area not under his control

yithril [1d\]: white has to move into the center
