HonFu [3k\]: hi ^^
HonFu [3k\]: hey breeze
easybreeze [10k\]: hello honfu :)
easybreeze [10k\]: hello everyone ^^
HonFu [3k\]: bloodstorm ^^ cruel name!
bloodstorm: as guest i only get kyu players
easybreeze [10k\]: no, sounds cool and bloodthirsty :D
bloodstorm: so name suits situation
yithril [1d\]: wow nobody this week huh? :)
HonFu [3k\]: only us few ... cozy
easybreeze [10k\]: ^-^
Flight [4k\]: did i tstart yet?
yithril [1d\]: not quite yet
easybreeze [10k\]: this is my first time here. so...is it weekly?
yithril [1d\]: we didnt have a lecture last week so i think people got out of cycle
yithril [1d\]: yeah
yithril [1d\]: its weekly
easybreeze [10k\]: i see, k. thanks
HonFu [3k\]: and your room still says date to be determined
yithril [1d\]: oh yeah
bloodstorm: Study Group: Yithril Sundays 2200 GMT it sais
HonFu [3k\]: yes, also
yithril [1d\]: partly my own laziness
yithril [1d\]: okay i guess we can just start
HonFu [3k\]: yay
yithril [1d\]: so i decided to do a pro game for this lecture because we havent done one in awhile
yithril [1d\]: pro games are excellent sources of study with or without commentary so i urge anyone to review one even if you dont understand everything
yithril [1d\]: today i picked a game from one of my favorite pros
yithril [1d\]: Lin Kaifeng who is also known as Rin Kaiho
yithril [1d\]: he
HonFu [3k\]: haha ^^
yithril [1d\]: has a really exceptional style 
yithril [1d\]: and he's an all around kind of player
yithril [1d\]: very aggressive but can hold back and be solid at the same time
yithril [1d\]: this is the 7th game of the 1969 honinbo match
yithril [1d\]: when u study pro games if ou have a game search engine
yithril [1d\]: try to look at alternatives to what they played
Flight [4k\]: where can u get a game search engine?
yithril [1d\]: see if your moves are played in any pro games and try to familiarize yourself with as much as possible
yithril [1d\]: even if you dont get it all
Flight [4k\]: the only one that I know is free is go4go
yithril [1d\]: i use gobaes
yithril [1d\]: secondly
Flight [4k\]: gobase = money
yithril [1d\]: while you may not have half the reading power
scrub [3d\]: haha, half
HonFu [3k\]: does go4go offer this shape research thing?
yithril [1d\]: try to appreciate the strategy and dont be afraid to really scrutinize their moves and ask yourself "did he really play right here"
Flight [4k\]: more like 10%
Flight [4k\]: nope
yithril [1d\]: thats all for today, thank you all for coming
Flight [4k\]: go4go only offers the sfg
Flight [4k\]: thanks jon
yithril [1d\]: If you miss a lecture they are available at: http://www.umich.edu/~goclub/index.html under resources.
alexanro [9k\]: thanks yithril
HonFu [3k\]: thanks a lot, Jon, twas great
bloodstorm: any1 game?
easybreeze [10k\]: thank you yithril
HonFu [3k\]: pro game reviews are fun
HonFu [3k\]: what will you do next week?
yithril [1d\]: no idea
yithril [1d\]: any suggestions?
HonFu [3k\]: solid play
Flight [4k\]: handicap games =D
alexanro [9k\]: yithril: how about a game from that pro that drunk much, then sobered up before winning
alexanro [9k\]: can're member his name
alexanro [9k\]: *can't
HonFu [3k\]: I always miss to defend because I think:
HonFu [3k\]: I really need sente now
HonFu [3k\]: and then I lose
HonFu [3k\]: so I'd like to see how pros work this problem
HonFu [3k\]: when do they defend although there are big moves
HonFu [3k\]: and when they just risk it
HonFu [3k\]: and why

(;W[qj]C[yithril [1d\]: we covered this move in our fuseki lecture and given teh strength of people here im sure everyone knows what is the function of this move
HonFu [3k\]: okay, which is bigger now, approach or check?
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: Jon, shouldn't this be in our room?
yithril [1d\]: felt it was more convenient this way
yithril [1d\]: non death gods tale people
Flight [4k\]: I'd rather approach

;B[do]C[HonFu [3k\]: R10
Flight [4k\]: what Honfu said

HonFu [3k\]: yes
yithril [1d\]: black went here
HonFu [3k\]: is this bigger
HonFu [3k\]: or check?
Flight [4k\]: I'd rather do this
yithril [1d\]: this is an option
yithril [1d\]: and i rather like it myself
yithril [1d\]: and htis is the game

(;B[cn]C[yithril [1d\]: in the game black went for the simple joseki

]
;W[fq]
;B[ci]C[yithril [1d\]: so simple so far
yithril [1d\]: which is why i liked this game
yithril [1d\]: now
yithril [1d\]: where should white go?
scrub [3d\]: now both players have a blighted star point
wildseven [-\]: w can c9 ?
Flight [4k\]: approach the bottom right
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: R6 I think
HonFu [3k\]: r 13?
yithril [1d\]: all good points
scrub [3d\]: I'd play R13 or C13, but I don't know
yithril [1d\]: c13 is the normal move in pro games i looked at
]
;W[cg]LB[ei:A][cl:B]C[Do we defend at A or do we think of elsewhere?yithril [1d\]: this move
yithril [1d\]: prepares the invasion at B
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: Because potentially sente
yithril [1d\]: plus
yithril [1d\]: it is also big for black to play on this side as well
yithril [1d\]: preventing the invasion
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: I have feeling R12 is bigger point for black
scrub [3d\]: yes, this looks nice
yithril [1d\]: your stones are a bit further apart but theres nothing i think superior with one over the other
yithril [1d\]: both are often played
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: I think this board screams B12
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: B R12
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: my bad
Flight [4k\]: B12?
]
(;B[qh]C[ChemBoy613 [6k\]: looks like only move to my eyes

(;W[qm]C[yithril [1d\]: this is simple and i recommend it

]
(;B[mq]C[yithril [1d\]: yes

(;W[rp]C[yithril [1d\]: in game was like this
yithril [1d\]: what other options are there for B?

yithril [1d\]: okay
yithril [1d\]: and?
HonFu [3k\]: r3?
scrub [3d\]: f17 
HonFu [3k\]: or is it too slow?
Flight [4k\]: extend?
Flight [4k\]: from bottom
]
(;B[ei]C[yithril [1d\]: and sakata decided to play solid and defend his stones
yithril [1d\]: but this is not the only option
yithril [1d\]: sakata is a rock solid player though
scrub [3d\]: What country have the player names been through btw? Rin Kaiho and Sakata Eio are more common in the west
Flight [4k\]: what's white's options here?
HonFu [3k\]: he likes solidity?
yithril [1d\]: yeah he does
yithril [1d\]: lin kaifeng is taiwanese
yithril [1d\]: usually chinese players that become japanese pros change their names based on the japanese pronunciations of the characters of their names
HonFu [3k\]: how is the real name of cho chikun?
yithril [1d\]: i got this game from a book "lin kaifengs select famous games", its in chinese so i dont know how to romanize them so well
yithril [1d\]: cho chihun
yithril [1d\]: he's korean
Flight [4k\]: how do u pronounce lin kaifeng in english?
yithril [1d\]: lin..kaifeng?
yithril [1d\]: thats his name?
Flight [4k\]: lol
HonFu [3k\]: impossible ^^
Flight [4k\]: oh
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: Lin.. Kaifeng?
Flight [4k\]: eh
scrub [3d\]: lin kaifeng is fine I see now, I was just used to Rin Kaiho :)
Flight [4k\]: I thougth chinese
]
;W[jc]C[Flight [4k\]: had weird pronunciations
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: taiwanese and chinese are slightly different in terms of pronounciations tho
yithril [1d\]: anyway
yithril [1d\]: nomenclature aside...
scrub [3d\]: sorry for the interruption
yithril [1d\]: back to the game ")
scrub [3d\]: :)
yithril [1d\]: so of course white goes straight for the top
Flight [4k\]: time to invade?
yithril [1d\]: you betcha
]
;B[fc]C[ChemBoy613 [6k\]: lookns necessary but where
yithril [1d\]: black approaches here
scrub [3d\]: so still
HonFu [3k\]: cant white easily extend and get a base?
yithril [1d\]: sure
yithril [1d\]: so?
Flight [4k\]: N17?
yithril [1d\]: n17
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: B can force extension in sente and jump
yithril [1d\]: leaves the corner open
HonFu [3k\]: attach

(;W[dc]TR[dc][dd][cg]C[yithril [1d\]: you play this
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: right this was my reading
Flight [4k\]: heh
yithril [1d\]: clean solid corner
scrub [3d\]: This is a very common move
yithril [1d\]: this is an important, common shape
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: H17?
HonFu [3k\]: is c15 now not possible?
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: followed by G15?
yithril [1d\]: yes but if you do c 15 you hurt f 17
yithril [1d\]: whtie will take the outside influence
yithril [1d\]: the idea is to be patient
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: h17 n17 g15 ?
Flight [4k\]: bottom looks open for business now
yithril [1d\]: top left
scrub [3d\]: bottom still small
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: tenuki impossible for black
yithril [1d\]: is the most important thing now
yithril [1d\]: tenuki is impossible

(;B[eg]C[yithril [1d\]: in lin's commentary he says this move is bad
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: rrreeeeeeaaaaaalllllyyyyyyyyyyyy
Flight [4k\]: how's that?
scrub [3d\]: nice move
yithril [1d\]: reason is
yithril [1d\]: the reason this move isnt good is whites followup
yithril [1d\]: which lin didnt see during the game
HonFu [3k\]: F15?
scrub [3d\]: white's move is the move black missed (like so often) =)
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: W will split
yithril [1d\]: where?
ChemBoy613 [6k\]: F15
yithril [1d\]: any other thoughts?
Flight [4k\]: or e15
HonFu [3k\]: f16?

yithril [1d\]: this move is very nice

yithril [1d\]: e13 is correct...
yithril [1d\]: i just said that

ChemBoy613 [6k\]: for B jon

yithril [1d\]: many of them face the center
HonFu [3k\]: hmm yes, maybe territory possible, huh?
Flight [4k\]: yea
yithril [1d\]: big territory is possible
Flight [4k\]: it looks like black's a bit short on territory
