bourbaki [1k\]: we can tell immediately that white is a jealous player
bourbaki [1k\]: try to build up on the side beforey ou move in
bourbaki [1k\]: this is on the 4th line so it will not be easy to make eyes
bourbaki [1k\]: black's stone is backed up by his two stones in the corner
shika12 [8k\]: wrong direction?
bourbaki [1k\]: basically, the idea of this review is: when looking at moves like this, they are theoretically unsound because one should build strength before diving in
]
(;B[cn]BL[2586.403]C[Very active plan.  My only complaint would be that maybe white would get thicker this way.wildseven [-\]: ahh
